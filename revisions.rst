Insert naturallistic falalcy quotes
===================================

"It just feels unnatural to me. I can't exactly say why but it just feels weird to be eating something made in a lab instead of the real animal."

"I think it is a good idea to reduce animal suffering and the environmental impact of farming but I am a little weirded out by it. It would definitely take a lot for me to transition from traditional meat products."

"I'm still worried that it might not be the safest to eat because of how it's grown... in a lab."

"I JUST CAN'T GET PAST THE WHOLE "UNNATURAL" AND "EATING A SCIENCE EXPERIMENT" BRAIN BLOCK.  AGAIN, WITH EVERYONE GOING "ORGANIC" AND "NON-MODIFIED" AND "ALL NATURAL" THIS JUST FLIES IN THE FACE OF ALL THAT."
