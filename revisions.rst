Future analyses to do
=====================

* examine heterogeneous effects using WTP measures, rather than just interest and concern.
* examine whether relationship between change in concern and change in interest in clean meat is driven by people *becoming concerned* or people *becoming unconcerned*.
* Examine whether the "embrace unnatural" treatment led to more positive sentiment towards the naturalness of clean meat, even though it increased concerns about its naturalness. Could examine this by comparing sentiment across treatment groups, or even by examining whether the negative relationship between interest in clean meat and concerns about naturalness became weaker in this group.
* correct for multiple hypothesis testing.
* add figures showing effects on secondary outcomes.
* construct measure of concerns from open-ended responses and then re-estimate results.
* examine effects of appeals and social information on anciallary attitudes, such as attitudes towards factory farming.

Other tasks
===========

* multiple hypothesis testing correction.
* remove outliers.
* describe what findings mean for people marketing clean meat. (e.g. intensve experimentation, rely on closed network communities of adopters?).
* provide better descriptions of outcome measures.
* provide better descriptions of what treatment effects mean. (e.g. write mini-section)

Update literature review
========================

Relevant work:

- importance of food naturalness, with extension to GMOs.
- pro-vaccination experiments and related research that provides us with expecations on treatment effects (including social norms and cultural intuitions).
- existing observational research on clean meat.

Food "naturalness" is an important factor in consumer decisionmaking. (for a review, see Roman2017,Siegrist2008).

The importance that consumers place on food naturalness is negatively related to interest in purchasing products made using new food technologies. For instance, Lusk2015 find that consumers' who reported that food naturalness was important in their food purchasing decisions were significantly less likely to state that they would choose dairy milk products that were produced using growth hormones or cloning over conventional dairy milk. Similarly, Lahteenmaki2002 show in a Scandinavian that consumers who reported caring more about the naturalness of food products held more negative attitudes towards GM foods.

We did not measure individual differences in food neophobia in this study (see Dovey2008 for a review). Given that clean meat products are aiming to replicate the taste and texture of products that consumers are already deeply familiar with, it is unlikely that individual tendencies to avoid new foods would explain much variation in intentions to eat clean meat products.

This is consistent with research on public acceptance of GM foods showing that perceived naturalness is an important determinant (e.g. Tenbult2005, Frewer1996).

Tenbult2005 show that GM products that are perceived as more natural are more likely to be accepted than GM products perceived as unnatural.

Footnote: Frewer2011 argue that perceived unnaturalness alone is insufficient to raise new food technologies to high levels of public rejection. As a result, there is reason to believe that cultured meat is much less likely to face extreme public resistance than GM foods and other technologies that raise concerns about unpredictable effects, uncontrolled use, and ethics.

At the same time, however, the psychology of meat-eating poses unique barriers to acceptance of cultured meat that are not present in other food technologies. Because cultured meat is likely to be seen by consumers as a fundamentally different way of producing meat, this may conflict with meat-eaters' identities, especially if clean meat products become associated with vegetarianism and other identities that elicit negative reactions from many consumers.

(cite articles on psychology of eating meat).

- study on effects of informing consumers about beer manufacturing process: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950329303000673. Main outcome seems to be difference between expected taste and reported taste.
- study on consumer acceptance of use of recycled water in meat products: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950329314000597.

Insert naturallistic fallacy quotes
-----------------------------------

The responses are an interesting mix of people who are clearly disgusted by the product, people who focus on the benefits to society, those who don't see the reason to give up eating conventional meat, and those who are on the fence (e.g. want to take a wait and see approach).

"It just feels unnatural to me. I can't exactly say why but it just feels weird to be eating something made in a lab instead of the real animal."

"I think it is a good idea to reduce animal suffering and the environmental impact of farming but I am a little weirded out by it. It would definitely take a lot for me to transition from traditional meat products."

"I'm still worried that it might not be the safest to eat because of how it's grown... in a lab."

"I just can't get past the whole "unnatural" and "eating a science experiment" brain block. Again, with everyone going "organic" and "non-modified" and "all natural" this just flies in the face of all that."

"gross me out. No way will i eat this stuff. It reminds me of Plankton's Chum Bucket food from Spongebob"

"That way of making meat is not natural. It seems strange to eat man made meat."

"It may have unknown health risks."

"Not sure of the process or how safe it will be in the long run."

"I know academically it's probably healthier, more humane, and won't taste any different. However there's a negative gut reaction to it I can't seem to push aside."
