I think the topic is interesting - biofabrication, including 'clean meat' has great potential in terms of sustainability and moral concerns. I also think it's nice that the study looked at both short- and long-term effects on attitudes. However, I think the research problem is too narrowly cast - essentially assessing the impact of specific social information against different interventions (unnatural debunking, embracing unnatural, descriptive norm). The concern here is that the comparisons are somewhat 'apples and oranges' and so any conclusions are fraught. For example, the authors claim four main contributions: the first is the large impact of social information over the interventions (but negativity bias would explain this; perhaps also source effects); the second is related to unnaturalness (but prior work has established concerns about naturalness and so would be a mere replication in the clean meat context); the third is that 'embracing unnaturalness' helps (but unfo! rtunately the authors don't really do much beyond this simple effect); and the fourth is dominance of health/natural over price/taste (but again, seems very substantive and prior natural work has already established natural concerns). Another concern about this work is the empirical findings: the authors spent a lot of time on main effects and great descriptive detail at each stage so the findings appeared unnecessarily convoluted, which obscured the potential interestingness. Because of this narrow casting and the empirical concerns, it's not clear what the broader takeaways of this work are for consumer acceptance of technology. I would encourage the authors to either consider a more substantively oriented journal for their work or reposition strongly on the theoretical front (perhaps around the embracing unnaturalness idea and the role of lay beliefs) - but doing so would require a great deal of conceptual and empirical work, which precludes consideration at the journal at this t! ime.

- Are there any broader theoretical reasons why we should think some arms would do better than other arms at X? E.g. one might expect negative social information and positive social norms information to mostly cancel each other out. Anything else that makes it more theoretically interesting? Related to this, one minor suggestion when editing the paper later: it is probably good to describe the treatments (currently just above 3.4) earlier and in more detail -- *why* these treatments? What is motivating about them?

- If we did a follow-up, it would 1) be quite late compared to the initial treatment Mar. 7, 2) there's no way I would have the patience to make sure everyone got it at precisely the right time such that they all observed it an equal amount of time after treatment. Would you be content with sending out just 1 round to everyone at once, such that some people saw the follow-up say 2 weeks after treatment and some saw it more like 6 weeks after treatment? Could do sensitivity analyses by duration of time since they saw the treatment. Alternatively, would you be happy to allocate it to people over time according to the date they initially did the treatment survey?
