- Are there any broader theoretical reasons why we should think some arms would do better than other arms at X? E.g. one might expect negative social information and positive social norms information to mostly cancel each other out. Anything else that makes it more theoretically interesting? Related to this, one minor suggestion when editing the paper later: it is probably good to describe the treatments (currently just above 3.4) earlier and in more detail -- *why* these treatments? What is motivating about them?

- If we did a follow-up, it would 1) be quite late compared to the initial treatment Mar. 7, 2) there's no way I would have the patience to make sure everyone got it at precisely the right time such that they all observed it an equal amount of time after treatment. Would you be content with sending out just 1 round to everyone at once, such that some people saw the follow-up say 2 weeks after treatment and some saw it more like 6 weeks after treatment? Could do sensitivity analyses by duration of time since they saw the treatment. Alternatively, would you be happy to allocate it to people over time according to the date they initially did the treatment survey?
