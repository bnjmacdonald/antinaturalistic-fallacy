Observational interest in clean meat
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^




Attitudinal barriers to support for clean meat.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FIGURE: means of interest in clean meat by different perceived concern.
    
    * purpose: show that "unnatural" concern is a major concern, along with "unhealthy" and "unsafe".

Perception that clean meat is "unnatural" is NOT the most prevalent concern expressed, but it is the most important attitudinal predictor of interest in clean meat products. Taste and cost will matter, of course. But these results suggest that the most important initial barrier is getting beyond the public's gut negative reactions.

On top of this, we observe that individuals who expect to reduce their meat consumption are significantly more attracted to clean meat.

We find no evidence that the amount of meat consumed at baseline -- or the amount of vegetarian meats -- are predictive of interest in clean meat products. This should come as a relief to advocates concerned that clean meat will only be attractive to individuals who already eat very little meat.

TODO: examine correlation between concerns and interest in wave 1 only.

TODO: for repeated exposure analysis, examine change among individuals who claim to have already known about clean meat.

1. Lifestyle barriers to support for clean meat.

People who see it as more difficult to completely eliminate meat from their diet are significantly more interested in cultured meat than those who think it would not be that difficult to eliminate conventional meat from their diet. 
    
2. Appeal effects

     a) main effects on interest in clean meat and ease of reducing meat consumption.
     b) variation in effects by subgroups.
     c) combating negative social information.

TODO: subgroup effects by initial sympathy for animals, conflicted omnivores, and desire to reduce meat consumption.


4. Negative social information effects

     a) main effects on interest in clean meat and ease of reducing meat consumption.
     b) discuss variation in effects by subgroups (or put in one mega-plot?)
     c) discuss whether any treatments were more effective in the face of negative social information than others (i.e. fight fire with fire or fight fire with reason?).



5. Susceptibility to the naturalistic fallacy

TODO: writeup?

looks like ideology is the most consistent predictor.

6. Demographic predictors of support for clean meat.
    
    a) which demographic subgroups

TODO: writeup?

Main effects
------------

* does any treatment affect trust?
* effects on benefits vs. costs

* do something with open-ended responses to articles.

* correlates of interest in clean meat (i.e. what kind of people are interested in it?)
    
    - are those interested people who already eat very little meat or who eat a lot of meat? 
    - are those interested veg-friendly, conflicted omnivores, or carnists? (do those interested eat any tofu already? i.e. would clean meat merely crowd out tofu?)
    - what are the demographics of those interested?

heterogeneity in treatment effects
----------------------------------

Core heterogeneity questions:
    
    * are effects concentrated among those who are already favorable towards clean meat, those are swing consumers, or those who are against clean meat? This will provide a sense of the extent to which the messages can convert swing and non-consumers into consumers.
    * are effects concentrated among those who already eat very little meat or who eat a lot of meat? This matters for potential for meat reduction.
    * are effects concentrated among veg-friendly individuals, conflicted omnivores, or carnists?


* Are individuals with the least favorable attitudes towards clean meat less influenced by the articles, and more influenced by the negative social information?

    - seems that treatments were overall less effective among those with less initial interest in clean meat. Also, they were more negatively affected by the negative social information.

* are effects larger among more trusting individuals?
* among respondents who agreed with negative social information, were treatments effective?

    - seems the answer is "yes" for a few outcomes. Need to look at other outcomes.

* are effects larger among respondents who were initially on the fence in wave 1?
* are effects larger among respondents who were initially concerned about whether cultured meat was unhealthy/unnatural? Or who were initially excited about benefits for health?

    - would be interesting to show whether there was actually a persuasive effect among people with initial concerns or who were on the fence. Could otherwise be that the treatments just gave supporters more reason to support clean meat.

* does previous exposure to clean meat increase impacts or decrease?
* are effects larger on people who were not expecting to decrease their meat consumption?

* are effects larger among "conflicted" omnivores? These people would be defined by eating a reasonable amount of meat but admitting that there are strong negative implications of meat (and saying they want to reduce meat consumption)

other analyses
--------------

do liberals and conservatives raise the same concerns about clean meat?

code text responses as "naturalistic fallacy" or not.

other
-----

* TODO: discrete choice.
* TODO: remove outliers
* TODO: standardize likert variables.

Extension
---------

* randomly expose individuals to clean meat once or multiple times.
* create a general "naturalistic fallacy" scale to see whether people are prone to this kind of thinking across a variety of products.
