<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- This paper reviews recent findings in moral psychology to examine the challenges that climate change poses to the moral judgment system and identifies strategies that communicators might use to overcome these challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- This paper is valuable not just for ideas about barriers to and potential communication strategies for invoking action on climate change, but also making progress on other moral issues (e.g. vegetarianism).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Little research has examined the extent to which moral concerns motivate public support for climate stabilization policies and behavior.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Six reasons why climate change fails to activate people's moral alarm systems:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Abstractness and cognitive complexity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- climate change does not generate rapid visceral emotional reactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Blamelessness of (perceived) unintentional action.</p>
<p>- Hence, climate change is judged less harshly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Guilty bias.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- in the face of messages that "you are guilty for causing climate change", individuals engage in motivated moral reasoning (e.g. blaming inaction on others or focusing on costs of mitigation).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Uncertainty breeds wishful thinking.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Moral tribalism.</p>
<p>- moral framing has typically been in terms of harm and fairness rather than authority or purity/sanctity.</p>
<p>- In addition, attitudes have acquired a political valence (which undermines support from conservatives since it affects how they evaluate new evidence, and they derive self-esteem from following the in-group).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Long time horizons and faraway places.</p>
<p>- future generations and far-away out-group members receive less weight in our moral communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- may be moderated by sins of omission vs. comission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Six strategies for increasing the recognition of climate change as a moral imperative:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Use existing moral values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- e.g. activate moral values such as purity/sanctity and authority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Burdens vs. Benefits.</p>
<p>- we are more concerned about saddling future generations with burdens than providing benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Emotional carrots, not sticks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- using emotions like hope, pridde, and gratitude may be more effective than inducing guilt and shame.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- focusing on the positive may help to create a positive feedback loop from positive emotions to giving to more positive emotions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Be wary of extrinsic motivators.</p>
<p>- could potentially help people to build habits of environmental action when they are not initially interested in the environment, but materialism and environmentalism have also been shown to be negatively related (so invoking more material concerns could backfire). Also, extrinsic incentives can crowd-out intrinsic ones form developing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Expand group identity.</p>
<p>- Since those mostly harmed by climate change will be animals, future generations, and far-away people, so we should focus on interventions that decrease this social/moral distance (e.g. getting people to think about their children as examples of future generations).&nbsp;</p>
<p>- hence, need to frame victims in terms of shared goals and identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Highlight positive social norms.</p>
<p>- Could highlight existing injunctive norms such as not being wasteful and recycling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- focus especially on leaders and prestigous individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- must be careful not to accidentally activate negative descriptive norms (e.g. "nobody in your neighborhood composts, but you should!").&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>},

 abstract = {<p>Some of the most important issues in society today affect more than one generation of people. In this article, the authors offer a conceptual overview and integration of the research on intergenerational dilemmas-decisions that entail a tradeoff between one's own self-interest in the present and the interests of other people in the future. Intergenerational decisions are characterized by a combination of intertemporal (i.e., behaviors that affect the future) and interpersonal (i.e., behaviors that affect other people) components. Research on intergenerational dilemmas identifies factors that emerge from these dimensions and how they interact with each other to influence intergenerational beneficence. Critically, phenomena that result from the intersection of these two dimensions-such as immortality striving through legacy creation-are especially important in distinguishing intergenerational decisions from other related decision contexts.</p>

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To test the effectiveness of messages designed to reduce vaccine misperceptions and increase vaccination rates for measles-mumps-rubella (MMR).METHODS: A Web-based nationally representative 2-wave survey experiment was conducted with 1759 parents age 18 years and older residing in the United States who have children in their household age 17 years or younger (conducted June{\textendash}July 2011). Parents were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 4 interventions: (1) information explaining the lack of evidence that MMR causes autism from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; (2) textual information about the dangers of the diseases prevented by MMR from the Vaccine Information Statement; (3) images of children who have diseases prevented by the MMR vaccine; (4) a dramatic narrative about an infant who almost died of measles from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fact sheet; or to a control group.RESULTS: None of the interventions increased parental intent to vaccinate a future child. Refuting claims of an MMR/autism link successfully reduced misperceptions that vaccines cause autism but nonetheless decreased intent to vaccinate among parents who had the least favorable vaccine attitudes. In addition, images of sick children increased expressed belief in a vaccine/autism link and a dramatic narrative about an infant in danger increased self-reported belief in serious vaccine side effects.CONCLUSIONS: Current public health communications about vaccines may not be effective. For some parents, they may actually increase misperceptions or reduce vaccination intention. Attempts to increase concerns about communicable diseases or correct false claims about vaccines may be especially likely to be counterproductive. More study of pro-vaccine messaging is needed.},

@article{Nyhan2015,
 abstract = {<p>Seasonal influenza is responsible for thousands of deaths and billions of dollars of medical costs per year in the United States, but influenza vaccination coverage remains substantially below public health targets. One possible obstacle to greater immunization rates is the false belief that it is possible to contract the flu from the flu vaccine. A nationally representative survey experiment was conducted to assess the extent of this flu vaccine misperception. We find that a substantial portion of the public (43%) believes that the flu vaccine can give you the flu. We also evaluate how an intervention designed to address this concern affects belief in the myth, concerns about flu vaccine safety, and future intent to vaccinate. Corrective information adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website significantly reduced belief in the myth that the flu vaccine can give you the flu as well as concerns about its safety. However, the correction also significantly reduced intent to vaccinate among respondents with high levels of concern about vaccine side effects - a response that was not observed among those with low levels of concern. This result, which is consistent with previous research on misperceptions about the MMR vaccine, suggests that correcting myths about vaccines may not be an effective approach to promoting immunization.</p>},

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- this short theoretical/conceptual piece presents ideas about resistance to vaccination through the lens of cultural attraction theory and epistemic vigilance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- this paper is valuable for (a) providing some hypotheses about the role of argumentation/trust in altering attitudes; (b) raising questions about how pro-vaccine messages get altered as they transmit through the network; and (c) providing good references to some recent experiments on vaccine hesitancy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Cultural attraction theory: culture is modified (as it is transmitted) in ways that fit with intuitive cognitive explanations (e.g. bloodletting just "made sense" until it was shown to be ineffective). This makes cultural ideas/beliefs operate as "attractors" towards some basin of attraction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Epistemic vigilance: information that runs against prior beliefs or which is counter-intuitive tends to be rejected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Application to vaccination:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- intuitive sense of disgust from small dose of contaminant. `</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- intuitive omission bias (worse to harm someone by acts of commission vs. omission).</p>
<p>- success of vaccination has made the threat of measles et cetera as much less salient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>these mechanisms make negative stories very likely to spread.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to spread counter-intuitive beliefs:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Trust: evidence must be accepted on trust (can't actually have monitored every data collection exercise, and most people don't know how to assess evidence). Especially problematic when source is seen as corrupted/biased.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Argumentation: difficult because there are so many small counter-arguments that the messenger often doesn't have time to address (e.g. I know someone who get sick from a vaccine, what are the side effects, what exactly is the data supporting vaccines, ...).</p>
<p>- so works best in lengthy face-to-face conversations with someone trustworthy or credible.&nbsp;</p>},

@article{Wilks2017,
 abstract = {<p>Positivity towards meat consumption remains strong, despite evidence of negative environmental and ethical outcomes. Although awareness of these repercussions is rising, there is still public resistance to removing meat from our diets. One potential method to alleviate these effects is to produce in vitro meat: meat grown in a laboratory that does not carry the same environmental or ethical concerns. However, there is limited research examining public attitudes towards in vitro meat, thus we know little about the capacity for it be accepted by consumers. This study aimed to examine perceptions of in vitro meat and identify potential barriers that might prevent engagement. Through conducting an online survey with US participants, we identified that although most respondents were willing to try in vitro meat, only one third were definitely or probably willing to eat in vitro meat regularly or as a replacement for farmed meat. Men were more receptive to it than women, as were politically liberal respondents compared with conservative ones. Vegetarians and vegans were more likely to perceive benefits compared to farmed meat, but they were less likely to want to try it than meat eaters. The main concerns were an anticipated high price, limited taste and appeal and a concern that the product was unnatural. It is concluded that people in the USA are likely to try in vitro meat, but few believed that it would replace farmed meat in their diet.</p>

@article{Yaqub2014,
 abstract = {<p>This paper provides a consolidated overview of public and healthcare professionals' attitudes towards vaccination in Europe by bringing together for the first time evidence across various vaccines, countries and populations. The paper relies on an extensive review of empirical literature published in English after 2009, as well as an analysis of unpublished market research data from member companies of Vaccines Europe. Our synthesis suggests that hesitant attitudes to vaccination are prevalent and may be increasing since the influenza pandemic of 2009. We define hesitancy as an expression of concern or doubt about the value or safety of vaccination. This means that hesitant attitudes are not confined only to those who refuse vaccination or those who encourage others to refuse vaccination. For many people, vaccination attitudes are shaped not just by healthcare professionals but also by an array of other information sources, including online and social media sources. We find that healthcare professionals report increasing challenges to building a trustful relationship with patients, through which they might otherwise allay concerns and reassure hesitant patients. We also find a range of reasons for vaccination attitudes, only some of which can be characterised as being related to lack of awareness or misinformation. Reasons that relate to issues of mistrust are cited more commonly in the literature than reasons that relate to information deficit. The importance of trust in the institutions involved with vaccination is discussed in terms of implications for researchers and policy-makers; we suggest that rebuilding this trust is a multi-stakeholder problem requiring a co-ordinated strategy.</p>
