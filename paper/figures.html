      <figcaption>Link between concerns about clean meat and interest in clean meat.
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Displays estimated standardized effects of a change in concerns about clean meat between waves 1 and 3 on corresponding change in interest in clean meat. Estimates are produced from a simple linear regression of each measure of interest in clean meat on dichotomous indicators representing each concern, as well as controls for baseline demographics and self-reported meat consumption. Dependent variables include: <i>would eat</i> (<q>Would you eat this product?</q>, 1-5 scale), <i>interest purchase</i> (<q>how interested are you in purchasing the clean meat product you just read about?</q>, 1-5 scale), and <i>feel</i> (<q>How do you feel about clean meat products?</q>, 1-7 scale). Dependent variables are standardized to have mean equal to zero and variance equal to one. Horizontal bars represent 90% and 95% confidence intervals.</span>

      <figcaption>Treatment effects (willingness-to-pay).
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Displays the marginal willingness-to-pay relative to conventional meatballs for respondents in each experimental cell, with results shown separately for waves 2 and 3. A value of 0 on the x-axis indicates that respondents were indifferent between clean (or vegetarian) meatballs and conventional meatballs. Horizontal bars represent 90% and 95% confidence intervals. Results estimated using conditional logistic regression.</span>

      <figcaption>Treatment effects on interest, concerns, and perceived benefits.
      <span style="font-weight: normal;">Displays average treatment effects (ATEs) for each treatment arm relative to control across three groups of outcomes: interest in clean meat, concerns about clean meat, and perceived benefits of clean meat. Panel 1 (top) displays treatment effects of the <i>debunk unnatural</i> appeal; Panel 2 displays treatment effects of the <i>descriptive norm</i> appeal; Panel 3 displays treatment effects of the <i>embrace unnatural</i> appeal; Panel 4 (bottom) displays treatment effects of exposure to negative social information. The <q>concerns</q> and <q>benefits</q> variables are dichotomous, representing whether a respondent raised the concern/benefit (<i>y=1</i>) or not (<i>y=0</i>). Interest variables include: <i>would eat</i> (<q>Would you eat this product?</q>, 1-5 scale), <i>interest purchase</i> (<q>how interested are you in purchasing the clean meat product you just read about?</q>, 1-5 scale), and <i>feel</i> (<q>How do you feel about clean meat products?</q>, 1-7 scale). The three interest variables are standardized to have mean equal to zero and variance equal to one. All dependent variables are measured in terms of the change since wave 1. Treatment effects are shown for wave 2 (immediately after treatment exposure) and wave 3 (10 weeks after exposure) separately. Points represent ATEs, surrounded by represent 90% and 95% confidence intervals.</span>

      <!-- Points in black represent the difference in means between exposed and unexposed respondents on changes in interest in clean meat and concerns about clean meat between waves 1 and 3. Gray points represent the differences in means between waves 1 and 2.  -->
