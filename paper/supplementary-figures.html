      <figcaption>Experimental balance on pre-treatment variables.
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">Displays pre-treatment balance on variables measured in wave 1 among respondents who completed all three survey waves (n=<span class="data" id="x0_3n"></span>). Each cell represents the p-value for a t-test in the difference in means between the control group and the experimental arm (x-axis) on a particular variable measured at baseline (y-axis). As shown, the experimental arms are well balanced with the control group on nearly all pre-treatment covariates. While there is some imbalance in self-reported servings of meat at baseline in the <i>debunk unnatural</i> and <i>descriptive norm</i> arms, correcting for this difference does not change the results reported above in any substantive way.</span>

      <figcaption>Treatment effects (discrete choice, odds ratio).
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">Displays odds ratios of selecting clean (or vegetarian) meatballs relative to conventional meatballs among respondents in each experimental cell, with results shown separately for waves 2 and 3. A value of 1.0 on the x-axis indicates that respondents were indifferent between clean (or vegetarian) meatballs and conventional meatballs. A value of 0.6 indicates that respondents were only 60% as likely to choose clean (or vegetarian) meatballs relative to conventional meatballs. Horizontal bars represent 90% and 95% confidence intervals. Results estimated using conditional logistic regression.</span>
        <!-- In the panels titled <q>Clean meatballs</q> and <q>Vegetarian meatballs</q>, points in black represent the average difference in the probability of choosing the product compared to <q>conventional meatballs</q>. In panels titled <q>$5 higher cost</q>, points in black represent the average difference in the probability of choosing a product that is $5 more expensive per pound. Whether or not respondents were exposed to anti-acceptance social information, they were significantly less likely to say they would purchase clean meatballs relative to conventional meatballs.  -->

      <figcaption>Heterogeneity in treatment effects by baseline interest in clean meat.
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">Displays ATEs of each treatment appeal and negative social information (<q>exposed</q>) on interest in clean meat. Results are estimated separately conditional on low vs. neutral vs. high levels of baseline interest in clean meat. Column 1 displays treatment effects of the three treatment appeals (and the effects of negative social information) on three measures of interest in clean meat &mdash; <i>would eat</i> (<q>Would you eat this product?</q>, 1-5 scale), <i>interest purchase</i> (<q>how interested are you in purchasing the clean meat product you just read about?</q>, 1-5 scale), and <i>feel</i> (<q>How do you feel about clean meat products?</q>, 1-7 scale) &mdash; where results are estimated separately for respondents with low vs. neutral vs. high levels of baseline <i>feel</i>. Columns 2 and 3 display the same effects, except that results are broken down by baseline <i>interest purchase</i> and baseline <i>would eat</i>, respectively. All dependent variables are measured as the change between waves 1 and 3. Points represent ATEs, surrounded by represent 90% and 95% confidence intervals.</span>

      <figcaption>Heterogeneity in appeal effects by number of servings of meat consumed per week at baseline.
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">Displays ATEs of each treatment appeal and negative social information (<q>exposed</q>) on interest in clean meat. Results are estimated separately conditional on low vs. moderate vs. high levels of baseline self-reported servings of meat consumed per week. Dependent variables are: <i>would eat</i> (<q>Would you eat this product?</q>, 1-5 scale), <i>interest purchase</i> (<q>how interested are you in purchasing the clean meat product you just read about?</q>, 1-5 scale), and <i>feel</i> (<q>How do you feel about clean meat products?</q>, 1-7 scale). All dependent variables are standardized to have mean equal to zero and variance equal to one, and are measured as the change between waves 1 and 3. Panel 1 (top) displays treatment effects of the <i>debunk unnatural</i> appeal; Panel 2 displays treatment effects of the <i>descriptive norm</i> appeal; Panel 3 displays treatment effects of the <i>embrace unnatural</i> appeal; Panel 4 (bottom) displays treatment effects of exposure to negative social information. Points represent ATEs, surrounded by represent 90% and 95% confidence intervals.</span>

        <span style="font-weight: normal;">Displays ATEs of each treatment appeal and negative social information (<q>exposed</q>) on interest in clean meat, conditional on whether respondents were concerned about the naturalness of clean meat at baseline (y-axis). Dependent variables are: <i>would eat</i> (<q>Would you eat this product?</q>, 1-5 scale), <i>interest purchase</i> (<q>how interested are you in purchasing the clean meat product you just read about?</q>, 1-5 scale), and <i>feel</i> (<q>How do you feel about clean meat products?</q>, 1-7 scale). All dependent variables are standardized to have mean equal to zero and variance equal to one, and are measured as the change between waves 1 and 3. Panel 1 (top) displays treatment effects of the <i>debunk unnatural</i> appeal, estimated separately for respondents who were concerned versus not concerned about the naturalness of clean meat at baseline; Panel 2 displays treatment effects of the <i>descriptive norm</i> appeal; Panel 3 displays treatment effects of the <i>embrace unnatural</i> appeal; Panel 4 (bottom) displays treatment effects of exposure to negative social information.

        <span style="font-weight: normal;">Displays the effects of each treatment appeal, estimated separately for respondents exposed to anti-acceptance social information versus respondents that were not exposed. Panel 1 (top) displays treatment effects of the <i>debunk unnatural</i> appeal; Panel 2 displays treatment effects of the <i>descriptive norm</i> appeal; Panel 3 (bottom) displays treatment effects of the <i>embrace unnatural</i> appeal. The <q>concerns</q> and <q>benefits</q> variables are dichotomous, representing whether a respondent raised the concern/benefit (<i>y=1</i>) or not (<i>y=0</i>). Interest variables include: <i>would eat</i> (<q>Would you eat this product?</q>, 1-5 scale), <i>interest purchase</i> (<q>how interested are you in purchasing the clean meat product you just read about?</q>, 1-5 scale), and <i>feel</i> (<q>How do you feel about clean meat products?</q>, 1-7 scale). The three interest variables are standardized to have mean equal to zero and variance equal to one. All dependent variables are measured as the change between waves 1 and 3.
