Outline

Section: introduction
---------------------

- [paragraph] clean meat offers many potential benefits, is attracting a great deal of attention, and is likely to be on the market soon.
- [paragraph] clean meat faces barriers because of naturalistic heuristic, as well as spatial/temporal distance of benefits and costs.
- [paragraph] two questions we address and why existing research is inadequate.
- [paragraph] overview of our study.
- [paragraph] description of three treatment arms.
- [paragraph] description of main results.
- [paragraph] abstraction to broader contributions.
- [paragraph] structure of paper.


Section: experimental design

Section: results
----------------

- [paragraph] roadmapping main findings.

Subsection: Naturalistic reasoning undermines clean meat acceptance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- [paragraph] question, link to figure, and description of figure contents.
- [paragraph] description of main findings in ``fig:barrier_concerns``.
- [paragraph] additional paragraph on main findings (i.e. whether entered email addresses)
- [paragraph] confrmation of findings in open-ended responses.
- [paragraph] limitation of results (i.e. not randomized).
- [paragraph] results driven by shock factor? Maybe.

Subsection: Effects of pro-clean meat appeals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- [paragraph] question and summary of overview of analyses
- [paragraph] description of wtp estimation specifications.
- [paragraph] practical description of wtp interpretation.
- [paragraph] description of strong effects of *embracing unnatural* appeal, with statistics.
- [paragraph] description of weak effects of other appeals, with statistics.
- [paragraph] description of interests and concerns specifications.

- [paragraph] initially encouraging effects of all three appeals, with statistics.
- [paragraph] however, effects were shortlived.
- [paragraph] In contrast, *embracing unnatural* appeal led to sustained effects (weak evidence).

Other Notes (and recycling bin)
===============================


However, the marginal effects of new information are likely to be particularly high for clean meat products, given that many consumers have not yet formed crystallized opinions. As a result, we should expect these attitudes to fluctuate more widely than public attitudes towards GM foods, vaccines, and related issues as consumers become exposed to different clean meat products, marketing campaigns, and media narratives.



we show that even small amounts of anti-adoption social information about clean meat can make consumers significantly more wary about clean meat products, and that these effects persist for a period of at least 10 weeks. These effects are strongest among individuals who already have low levels of interest in clean meat.

we show that, while pro-clean meat appeals based on debunking the naturalistic fallacy or conveying social norms can counteract nearly all of the negative effects of anti-adoption social information <i>in the short term</i>, the effects of the pro-clean meat appeals we evaluate in this study are indistinguishable from zero after 10 weeks.

Here, we show that, while pro-clean meat appeals based on debunking or conveying social norms can counteract nearly all of the negative effects of anti-adoption social information <i>in the short term</i>, these counteracting effects decay over time and are indistinguishable from zero after 10 weeks.


given that these large effects emerged from extremely small amounts of negative social information from completely anonymous individuals.


This finding raises serious concerns about public acceptance of new technologies &mdash; such as clean meat products &mdash; that activate consumers' naturalistic heuristic, suggesting that in addition to it being difficult to improve public acceptance through informational campaigns, small amounts of anti-acceptance information can be extremely effective at eroding consumer interest in these products.
