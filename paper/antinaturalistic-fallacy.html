    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>The naturalistic heuristic of <q>what is natural is good</q> poses a serious barrier to consumer adoption of genetically modified foods, childhood vaccinations, and related technologies. While existing evidence suggests that pro-acceptance messaging appeals based on debunking this heuristic are ineffective at increasing consumer acceptance, there is little evidence on whether this ineffectiveness extends to new products for which consumers have not yet formed crystallized opinions. In this study, we examine three messaging strategies &mdash; direct debunking, embracing unnaturalness, and descriptive norms &mdash; for overcoming consumer resistance in the context of a new food technology: <q>clean meat</q> &mdash; also known as <q>cultured</q> or <q>in vitro</q> meat. We compare the effects of these three pro-clean meat appeals against <q>anti-clean meat social information</q> from anonymous consumers. We find persistent negative effects of anti-clean meat social information over 10 weeks. In contrast, improvements in consumer acceptance following the direct debunking and descriptive norms appeals were short-lived. The only appeal to successfully offset the undermining effects of anti-clean meat social information over 10 weeks was the embrace unnaturalness appeal, suggesting that advocates wishing to enhance consumer acceptance of new food technologies should focus on how these technologies are similar to products that also seem <q>unnatural</q> but which are already widely adopted by consumers.</p>

  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <section id="sec-introduction">

    <p><q>Clean meat</q> &mdash; i.e. meat products made from cultured animal tissues, also known as <q>cultured</q> or <q>in vitro</q> meat &mdash; has the potential to significantly reduce animal suffering and environmental damage while also improving human health. Clean meat products have been the source of a great deal of media attention over the past few years as improvements in clean meat technologies have dramatically reduced production costs, with companies promising to have clean meat products available in stores by 2018.<span class="footnote">See, for instance, <span class="citet"><a href="#garfield2017"></a><a href="#ferdman2015"></a><a href="#addady2016"></a><a href="#stone2016"></a></span>.</span></p>
    
    <!-- todo: mention specific promises/goals of Hampton Creek, Memphis Meats, etc </span> -->
    
    <p>However, clean meat products are at risk of attracting a great deal of public resistance. First, many consumers attach labels such as <q>artificial</q> or <q>lab-grown</q> to these products, given that clean meat production processes conflict with the widespread heuristic that <q>what is natural is good</q>.<span class="footnote">For a systematic review of research on the importance of <q>food naturalness</q> to consumers, see <span class="citet"><a href="#roman2017"></a></span>.</span> This <q>naturalistic heuristic</q> &mdash; where consumer attitudes are biased in favor of products that are more congruent with their notion of what is <q>natural</q> for humans to consume and what kinds of organisms/chemicals occur in the natural environment &mdash; is not unique to clean meat. Genetically modified (GM) foods, vaccines, and other technological advances have faced similar barriers to acceptance in the general public.<span class="footnote">For research on public acceptance of GM foods, see <span class="citet"><a href="#lusk2015" id=""></a><a href="#siegrist2008" id=""></a><a href="#costa-font2008" id=""></a><a href="#saher2006" id=""></a><a href="#frewer1996"></a></span>. On vaccines, see <span class="citet"><a href="#miton2015"></a><a href="#yaqub2014"></a><a href="#nyhan2014"></a></span>. On the use of nanotechnology in food packaging and production, see <span class="citet"><a href="#siegrist2009"></a><a href="#siegrist2007"></a></span>. On other topics, see <span class="citet"><a href="#runge2017" id=""></a><a href="#okeefe2016"></a><a href="#rollin2011" id=""></a><a href="#frewer2011" id=""></a><a href="#siegrist2008"></a></span>.</span> In short, while the naturalistic heuristic may nudge consumers towards choosing food products with less added sugars, fats, and preservatives, at the same time this heuristic poses a major barrier to public acceptance of technologies that promise far-reaching benefits for public health, environmental sustainability, animal welfare, and scientific advancement. Second, the expected benefits of clean meat are temporally distant (e.g. avoiding catastrophic climate change) and spatially removed (e.g. animal suffering in factory farms, deforestation), making it difficult for consumers to incorporate these benefits into their decision-making calculus.<span class="footnote">For reviews of existing research on individual decision-making with temporally and/or spatially distant consequences, see <span class="citet"><a href="#wade-benzoni2009"></a><a href="#markowitz2012"></a></span>.</span></p>

    <p>While clean meat products are set to become widely available to consumers in the near future, few studies have examined consumer attitudes towards clean meat products, how these attitudes are shaped by short snippets of information exchanged in social networks, and what kinds of pro-clean meat messaging campaigns can be effective at generating sustained improvements in consumer acceptance. This lack of research is an important oversight, given that public opinion could very easily crystallize against clean meat products, thereby undermining the far-reaching potential of clean meat products for combating environmental degradation and improving animal welfare.</p>

    <p>In this study, we address two questions. First, to what extent does perceived <q>naturalness</q> undermine consumer interest in clean meat products? Existing work shows that many consumers are concerned about the naturalness and health effects of clean meat products <span class="citep"><a href="#wilks2017"></a><a href="#hocquette2015"></a><a href="#laestadius2015"></a><a href="#hart2017"></a></span>, and a great deal of research has shown that perceived food naturalness plays an important role in consumers' food choices <span class="citep"><a href="#roman2017"></a><a href="#lusk2015"></a><a href="#tenbult2005"></a></span>, yet there is little direct evidence that concerns about the naturalness of clean meat products are more important in undermining consumer acceptance relative to conventional consumer concerns such as cost and taste. <span class="footnote"><a class="citet" href="#siegrist2017"></a> show that consumers are more accepting of risk (e.g. chance of getting colon cancer from eating meat) when meat is produced using conventional methods rather than in vitro. Yet the authors do not examine the role of perceived naturalness in consumers' overall interest in clean meat, nor do they compare the role of perceived naturalness to other potential consumer concerns.</span></p>

    <p>Second, how effective are pro-clean meat appeals &mdash; either based on <q>debunking unnaturalness</q>, <q>embracing unnaturalness</q>, or conveying <q>descriptive social norms</q> &mdash; at creating sustained improvements in consumer acceptance of clean meat products compared to anti-clean meat information received from other potential consumers? Existing research has cast a pessimistic light on the potential for improving public acceptance of vaccines and other technologies through informational appeals, particularly appeals aimed at debunking misperceptions <span class="citep"><a href="#nyhan2015"></a><a href="#nyhan2014"></a><a href="#lewandowsky2012"></a></span>. It is not clear, however, whether this ineffectiveness of pro-acceptance messaging extends to novel technologies, for which consumers' opinions have not yet crystallized. Moreover, existing findings do not examine the flip side of the persuasion question: are <i>anti</i>-acceptance appeals just as ineffective at moving individual opinions as pro-adoption appeals? Given widespread risk aversion among consumers and greater attention paid to a decision's downsides <span class="citep"><a href="#nelson2001"></a><a href="#tversky1992"></a><a href="#camerer2004"></a></span>, there is good reason to believe that consumer attitudes will be more sensitive to negative information about clean meat products. However, there is little available evidence on whether such an asymmetry in the effects of information appeals exists in the context of clean meat products, GM foods, vaccines, and related technologies.</p>

    <!-- <span class="footnote">cf. <span class="citet"><span class="todo">...</span></span></span> -->


    <!-- Asymmetric effects bears some similarity to the backfire effect of information.  -->

    <!-- Appeals may have had little effect because of skepticism. -->
    
    <!--  It is not clear whether the ineffectiveness of messaging appeals are symmetric, such that anti-acceptance appeals would have face just as much difficulty in shifting the attitudes of the typical consumer as pro-acceptance appeals -->

    <!-- Few studies on vaccines, GM foods, or nuclear power have examined the effectiveness of competing messaging strategies at overcoming these naturalistic concerns and increasing consumer acceptance. <span class="footnote">For exception, see <span class="citet"><a href="#nyhan2015"></a><a href="#nyhan2014"></a></span>.</span> In particular, we are not aware of any experimental research that compares the efficacy of different messaging strategies for increasing consumer acceptance of clean meat products. Given that clean meat products are expected to become widely available to consumers in the next couple of years, this lack of research on effective strategies for overcoming consumers' naturalistic heuristic raises important concerns about the likely acceptance and uptake of clean meat products.</p> -->

    <p>In this study, we address these two questions through a 2x4 full factorial survey experiment that examines how three messaging strategies and anti-acceptance social information affect individual acceptance of clean meat products over a period of 10 weeks. We measure acceptance of clean meat products using a discrete choice experiment, along with a set of behavioral intention and attitudinal measures. To examine the effects of <i>anti-acceptance social information</i>, we randomly assign participants to receive social information or not, consisting of a sample of five negative reactions towards clean meat from other survey respondents (e.g. <q>Artificial meat sounds disgusting</q>). Next, to examine the efficacy of pro-clean meat appeals, we randomly assign participants to read either a <i>placebo</i> article or one of three pro-clean meat articles: a <i>debunking unnatural</i> appeal, <i>embrace unnatural</i> appeal, or <i>descriptive norm</i> appeal. Whereas the <i>debunking unnatural</i> appeal is aimed at weakening consumers' reliance on the naturalistic heuristic by illustrating some of its fallacies, the <i>embrace unnatural</i> appeal takes a softer approach by asking consumers to recognize that there are many exceptions to the naturalistic heuristic (without asking them to abolish the heuristic altogether). Finally, the <i>descriptive norm</i> appeal does not deliver any persuasive arguments that invoke the naturalistic fallacy, instead conveying a descriptive social norm that many consumers are excited about clean meat and would like to try it once it becomes available in their area.</p>

    <!-- In this study, we set out to answer three main questions: (1) To what extent is consumer acceptance of clean meat products driven by concerns about health, safety, and <q>naturalness</q> &mdash; each of which is indicative of the naturalistic heuristic &mdash; rather than more conventional consumer concerns about cost and taste? (2) As a novel consumer product, how susceptible is consumer acceptance of clean meat products to <i>anti-acceptance social information</i>, consisting of negative reactions towards clean meat products from peers? And (3) how effective is <q>direct debunking</q> of the naturalistic heuristic at increasing consumer acceptance of clean meat products compared to a simple <q>social norm</q> pro-clean meat message and a placebo message?</p> -->
    
    <!-- Building on recent work examining the effectiveness of messaging strategies for improving public acceptance of vaccines \citep[e.g.][]{Nyhan2014</i>, in this study we examine how messages and social information affect individual acceptance of clean meat products and susceptibility to the naturalistic fallacy. Specifically, we implement a 4x2 full factorial survey experiment with three different anti-naturalistic messages (and a placebo message) crossed with whether or not subjects are exposed to social information beforehand (i.e. how previous survey respondents have reacted to clean meat). -->
  
    <!-- Could be that attitudes towards these products are difficult to shift in either direction. -->

    <!-- SUMMARY OF MAIN FINDINGS -->
    <!-- 
    1. Wariness is driven by concerns about health and naturalness 
    2. Ineffectiveness of pro-acceptance messages.
    3. Asymmetric effects.
    -->
    <p>We produce three main results. First, we show that consumers' wariness about clean meat is driven far more by concerns about whether clean meat is natural and healthy &mdash; which are symptoms of the naturalistic fallacy &mdash; than how clean meat products taste or how much they cost. Second, we show that the <i>embrace unnatural</i> appeal led to sustained increases in consumers' willingness-to-pay and interest in clean meat over a 10 week period. In contrast, while the <i>debunking unnatural</i> and <i>descriptive norm</i> appeals led to encouraging short-term improvements in consumer acceptance of clean meat, these effects were short-lived. Third, in stark contrast to the null effects of these two appeals, we show that small snippets of negative social information about clean meat from complete strangers significantly undermines acceptance of clean meat, and that these effects persist for at least 10 weeks. These effects are strongest among individuals who were least interested in clean meat at baseline.</p>

    <!-- todo: also cite Broockman paper on ineffectiveness of persuasive campaigns. -->

    <!--  pro-clean meat appeals based on debunking the naturalistic fallacy or conveying descriptive social norms -->
    <!-- This finding is consistent with recent findings on the ineffectiveness of debunking messaging at improving attitudes towards vaccinations, XXXX, and XXXX. Our results, however, include an additional twist: while pro-clean meat messages were ineffective, very small amounts of negative anti-clean meat information from others has a persistent effect. -->

    <!-- CONTRIBUTIONS
    1. shows that naturalness is important in undermining support for clean meat.
    2. pro-acceptance messages are ineffective even for new technologies.
    3. Effects are asymmetric, which raises serious concerns.
     -->
    <p>This study makes four main contributions. First, we provide disconcerting evidence about the asymmetric effectiveness of pro- vs. anti-adoption appeals towards new food technologies, such that extremely small amounts of negative social information led to sustained reductions in consumer acceptance of clean meat, while two of the three pro-clean meat appeals had no discernible effects after 10 weeks. While the ineffectiveness of the <i>debunking unnatural</i> appeal is consistent with existing research on the challenges of correcting misinformation <span class="citep">see <a href="#nyhan2014"></a><a href="#lewandowsky2012"></a></span>, our results extend add to this literature in two ways. First, our results show that the ineffectiveness of direct debunking strategies extends to novel technologies (such as clean meat) for which consumer attitudes have not yet crystallized. Second, we demonstrate asymmetric information effects, such that consumer attitudes are particularly susceptible to small amounts of anti-clean meat social information that activates the naturalistic heuristic.</p>

    <!-- While a great deal of existing research shows that individuals are more likely to update their beliefs when exposed to information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs than when exposed to information that disconfirms these beliefs <span class="todo"></span>, we show that this asymmetric updating is <i>not</i> limited only to individuals who already held strong anti-clean meat attitudes at baseline.  -->

    <p>Third, on a more optimistic note, we provide evidence that an <i>embracing unnaturalness</i> messaging strategy can be effective at improving public acceptance of new food technologies. An attractive feature of this strategy that may be responsible for its success is the leveraging of consumers' mental models and <q>cultural intuitions</q> <span class="citep"><a href="#miton2015"></a><a href="#ecker2011"></a><a href="#johnson1999"></a></span> about what is healthy/safe to consume, effectively equating clean meat products with other products consumers have already become accustomed to. Fourth, this is one of the first studies to provide direct evidence that consumer acceptance of clean meat products is much more strongly related to concerns about the health and naturalness than conventional concerns about price and taste. As a result, the <q>naturalistic fallacy</q> is likely to be a serious barrier to public acceptance as clean meat products begin to enter the market.</p>

    <!-- While previous research has shown that consumers are concerned about the naturalness and health consequences of clean meat products <a class="citep" href="#wilks2017"></a>, these studies have not systematically shown at the individual level that consumers who become more concerned about the naturalness of clean meat products become less interested in these products over time.</p> -->

    <!-- whereas the <i>debunking unnatural</i> appeal seeks to shatter readers' mental model of what is healthy/safe to consume without providing an alternative narrative, the <i>embrace unnatural</i> approach helps to maintain coherence in readers' mental model, asking readers to recognize that there are many exceptions to the naturalistic heuristic without asking them to abolish the heuristic altogether. -->

    <!-- First, we show that the <i>embracing unnatural</i> appeal &mdash; which acknowledges the naturalistic heuristic and does not seek to refute whether clean meat is natural &mdash; led to persistent improvements in consumer willingness-to-pay and attitudes towards clean meat over a 10 week period. We also provide some evidence that an appeal to <i>descriptive norms</i> (cite dynamic social norms as reason for effectiveness?) &mdash; in which respondents are led to believe that many other consumers are interested in clean meat &mdash; can be effective at improving consumer acceptance, although our evidence for these effects are considerably weaker.</p> -->

    <h2 id="ssec-data-collection">Data collection</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Data was collected in three online survey waves over an 11 week period with participants recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Each participant was paid US$0.50 for completing the baseline survey, US$0.50 for completing the treatment survey, and US$0.50 for completing the endline survey (for a total of US$1.50 for participation in the entire study). Following the baseline survey, we recontacted participants via email. We recruited 3200 participants (400 per cell for the 4x2 experiment), of which there were <span class="data" id="x0_1n"></span> valid survey responses in the baseline survey wave. <span class="data" id="x0_2n"></span> respondents completed the treatment survey wave (<span class="data" id="x0_2p"></span>%) approximately one week after baseline, while <span class="data" id="x0_3n"></span> respondents completed the endline survey wave (<span class="data" id="x0_3p"></span>%) approximately ten weeks following treatment exposure. <a class="figure" href="#fig-subgroup-effects-unnatural"></a> (<a href="#appendix">Appendix</a>) displays the balance across experimental arms among respondents who completed all three survey waves, showing that this attrition did not lead to any substantial imbalances between experimental arms on pre-treatment outcomes or other variables of interest.</p>

      <!-- Previous research on MTurk with similar multi-wave designs have yielded retention rates around 80% between baseline and endline, which would leave us with approximately 320 subjects per cell. -->

      <p><b>Wave 1 (Baseline survey).</b> First, participants were asked to complete a 10 minute survey containing questions on demographics, current levels of meat consumption, attitudes, and potential moderators. All participants were provided with information about what the term <q>clean meat</q> refers to, what makes clean meat different than conventional meat production, and what some of the purported environmental, health, and ethical benefits of consuming clean meat products are. This information was meant to familiarize participants with clean meat products, since the term is not yet common knowledge.</p>

      <p><b>Wave 2 (Treatment exposure and immediate reactions).</b> Approximately one week after completing the baseline survey, the same participants were recontacted and asked to complete a second online survey. At this stage, participants were randomly assigned to: (a) either receive anti-acceptance social information or not; and (b) read one of four half-page appeals. See <a class="subsection" href="#ssec-experimental-conditions"></a> for more details on experimental conditions. Immediately after reading the article, all participants completed a short survey eliciting their reactions to the article, willingness to pay for clean meat products, interest in clean meat products, and other outcome measures as described in <a class="subsection" href="#ssec-outcomes"></a>.</p>

      <p><b>Wave 3 (Endline survey).</b> Approximately 10 weeks after completing the treatment exposure survey, the same participants were recontacted and asked to complete a followup survey. The followup survey elicited participants' willingness to pay for clean meat products, interest in further information about clean meat products and vegetarian products, attitudes towards clean meat, and other outcome measures as described in <a class="subsection" href="#ssec-outcomes"></a>.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="ssec-experimental-conditions">Experimental conditions</h2>
    <div>
      <p>This study was organized as a randomized 2x4 full factorial design, examining how (1) anti-acceptance social information and (2) pro-clean meat messaging appeals affect individual acceptance of clean meat products and susceptibility to the naturalistic fallacy. In the treatment survey, study participants were randomly assigned to: (a) either receive anti-acceptance social information or not; and (b) read one of four half-page appeals, three of which were pro-clean meat appeals while the fourth was a placebo article about the health benefits of walking. Participants assigned to receive anti-acceptance social information were shown a web page listing five short quotes from previous survey respondents expressing negative sentiment about clean meat (e.g. <q>This seems very unnatural. I don't feel comfortable about this.</q>, <q>Artificial meat sounds disgusting</q>). These quotes were extracted from a separate survey on clean meat attitudes and were the same for all participants assigned to read the quotes. Participants who were not assigned to receive anti-acceptance information were shown nothing instead.</p>

      <p>All participants were then randomly assigned to read one of four articles: a <i>placebo</i> message, <i>debunking unnatural</i> appeal, <i>embrace unnatural</i> appeal, or a <i>descriptive norm</i> appeal. Each message was approximately 150-200 words in length, with three images that helped to convey the main message. The <i>placebo</i> message urged participants to walk more, making no mention of clean meat products or meat consumption. The <i>debunking unnatural</i> appeal is similar to the <q>mis-perception correction</q> messaging strategy commonly used to combat anti-vaccination beliefs.<span class="footnote">See, for instance: <span class="citet"><a href="#who2017"></a><a href="#newyork2012"></a></span>.</span> Specifically, this appeal invokes the naturalistic heuristic in order to argue against its application in the case of clean meat products, pointing out that some seemingly <q>natural</q> compounds are clearly bad (e.g. arsenic) while other seemingly <q>unnatural</q> products clearly have positive benefits (e.g. antibiotics). Despite the widespread use of this messaging strategy, there is little evidence that such corrections are effective at countering negative attitudes/beliefs <span class="citep"><a href="#nyhan2015"></a><a href="#nyhan2014"></a></span>.<span class="footnote">cf. <a href="#dixon2015" class="citet"></a>.</span> It is not clear, however, whether the ineffectiveness of this messaging strategy extends to new technologies &mdash; such as clean meat products &mdash; in which consumers have not had sufficient exposure to form crystallized opinions.</p> 

      <!-- <span class="todo">cite frewer 1996?</span> -->

      <p>While the <i>embrace unnatural</i> also draws attention to the naturalistic heuristic, it is different in emphasis. Rather than debunking the naturalistic heuristic, the <i>embrace unnatural</i> appeal emphasizes how clean meat products are similar to many other seemingly <q>unnatural</q> foods that have already been widely accepted by consumers, thereby encouraging readers to add clean meat products to the set of products they deem acceptable. Specifically, the <i>embrace unnatural</i> appeal describes how nearly all foods we eat today have been artificially engineered through selective breeding and other practices such that they no longer resemble their naturally occurring ancestors. This appeal is designed to more directly align clean meat products with consumers' intuitions about whether clean meat is likely to be beneficial to their health, thereby making it easier to accept the counter-intuitive conclusion that clean meat is a safe and healthy product despite its seemingly <q>unnatural</q> qualities.<span class="footnote">For a discussion of how <q>culturally shared intuitions</q> &mdash; such as the naturalistic heuristic &mdash; may affect beliefs towards vaccines and similar technologies, see <a href="#miton2015" class="citet"></a>.</span> From a cognitive dissonance perspective, this messaging strategy frames an individual's decision to orient their attitudes favorably towards clean meat as the path of least resistance in resolving the dissonance. In order to rationalize continued skepticism towards clean meat products when faced with this <i>embrace unnatural</i> messaging strategy, individuals would need to find a way of explaining their past consumption of many products that seem patently <q>unnatural</q>, making it easier to instead add one more item to the set of <q>hard to view as <q>natural</q>, but probably still safe and healthy</q> products. In a similar vein, whereas the <i>debunking unnatural</i> appeal seeks to shatter readers' mental model of what is healthy/safe to consume without providing an alternative narrative, the <i>embrace unnatural</i> approach helps to maintain coherence in readers' mental models, asking readers to recognize that there are many exceptions to the naturalistic heuristic without asking them to abolish the heuristic altogether. <span class="footnote">For a review of research on the importance of mental models in misinformation correction, see <a href="#lewandowsky2012" class="citet"></a>.</span> </p>
      
      <!-- This messaging strategy is meant to leverage consumers' <q>cultural intuitions</q> <a href="#miton2015" class="citep"></a> about what is acceptable by equating clean meat products with other products they have already accepted. -->
      <!-- [todo] Screenshots are provided in the appendix -->

      <!-- <p>  Specifically, by emphasizing how clean meat is similar to many other kinds of foods that have been widely accepted by most consumers, readers are encouraged to add clean meat products to the set of products that are deemed acceptable rather.</p> -->

      <!-- <span class="todo">integrate more theory into description of treatments.</span> -->

      <p>Finally, the <i>descriptive norm</i> appeal conveys a descriptive social norm that many consumers are excited about clean meat and would like to try it once it becomes available in their area. This appeal makes no persuasive effort to debunk the naturalistic heuristic or to communicate the benefits of clean meat. The effectiveness of social norm appeals have been documented in a variety of domains. <span class="footnote">See, for instance, <span class="citet"><a href="#steg2009"></a><a href="#gerber2008"></a><a href="#goldstein2008"></a></span>.</span> In the case of clean meat products, descriptive information about others' attitudes and behaviors should be especially important when considering new products and technologies that appear risky, since a large base of early adopters provides an important signal to other consumers that the products are healthy and safe.</p>

      <!-- Instead, it merely signals to readers that many other consumers seem to be excited about clean meat products, thereby drawing attention concerned about potential health and safety implications.  -->

For the analyses reported in <a class="section" href="#sec-results"></a>, all dependent variables are standardized to have mean equal to zero and variance equal to one, with the exception of dichotomous variables which we leave unstandardized. We measure respondents' behavioral intentions and attitudes towards clean meat as follows:<span class="footnote">Participants were also provided with several opportunities across the three survey waves to share their attitudes towards clean meat products in an open-ended format.</span></p>
      <ul class="simple">
        <li><i>Willingness to pay for clean meat.</i> We infer participants’ willingness to pay for clean meat from a discrete choice experiment at the end of the treatment survey. Respondents were presented with sets of descriptions of two or three different products, each consisting of a set of 2 attributes: (a) Product: clean meatballs, vegetarian meatballs, conventional meatballs; (b) Price per lb: $5, $10, $15, or $20. A full factorial design accounting for all interactions among those exposed to information about clean meat consists of 12 different combinations (3 products x 4 prices). We asked respondents to answer one of two alternative blocks of 6 questions (randomly assigned).</li>
        <li><i>Interest in clean meat.</i> We collect several attitudinal measures on attitudes towards clean meat: <q>how interested are you in purchasing the clean meat product you just read about?</q> (<i>interest purchase</i>, 1-5 scale from <q>not interested at all</q> to <q>extremely interested</q>), <q>Would you eat this product?</q> (<i>would eat</i>, 1-5 scale from <q>definitely not</q> to <q>definitely yes</q>), and <q>How do you feel about clean meat products?</q> (<i>feel</i>, 1-7 scale from <q>extremely negative</q> to <q>extremely positive</q>). In waves 1 and 2, but not in the endline survey, we also asked participants: <q>Would you like to be notified when clean meat products are available in your area?</q> (<q>yes/maybe/no</q> and dichotomous measure of whether respondent provided an e-mail address in follow-up question shown to those answering <q>yes</q> or <q>maybe</q>).</li>
        <li><i>Concerns about clean meat.</i> We provided participants with a list of five potential concerns about clean meat products &mdash; unhealthy, unnatural, unsafe, taste, and price &mdash; and asked them to select all that apply. Participants were also permitted to select <q>I have no concerns</q> or to enter another concern not listed. We also provided participants with an open-ended text box to state their most important concerns about clean meat products.</li>
        <li><i>Perceived benefits of clean meat.</i> We provided participants with a list of six potential benefits of clean meat products &mdash; healthier, safer, more environmentally sustainable, may reduce farm animal suffering, tastier, and cheaper &mdash; and asked them to select all that apply. Participants were also permitted to select <q>I foresee no benefits</q> or to enter another benefit not listed. We also provided participants with an open-ended text box to state the most important benefits that clean meat products offered in their opinion.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <!--  -->
      <!-- We also examine whether the experimental conditions influenced respondents' attitudes on several related topics:
      <ul class="simple">
        <li><i>Attitudes towards factory farming.</i> We collected four attitudinal measures on meat consumption and factory farming. First, participants were asked to rate whether and how much factory farming contributes to animal suffering and whether this is an issue they care about. Second, participants were asked to rate whether and how much factory farming contributes to environmental degradation, and whether this is an issue they care about. Third, participants were asked to rate whether they think it is morally preferable to avoid eating factory farmed meat. Fourth, participants were asked whether they would be interested in receiving tips on how to reduce their meat consumption.</li>
        <li><i>Perceptions of social norms.</i> On a seven point scale, participants were asked whether they agree or disagree with the statement that <q>more and more people in the US are reducing their meat consumption</q> (1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree).</li>
        <li><i>Perceptions of vegetarians.</i> Participants were asked to state their feelings towards vegetarians on a seven point scale (1=extremely positive, 7=extremely negative). </li>
        <li><i>Perceptions of intelligence and sentience.</i> Participants were asked to rate seven species of animals on a 1-7 scale in terms of perceived intelligence (1=very unintelligent, 7=very intelligent). Participants were also asked to rate how capable these seven species of animals are of experiencing pain and suffering on a 1-7 scale (1=completely incapable, 7=highly capable). We use <q>humans</q> as a comparison group in the analyses.</li>
        <li><i>Ease of reducing meat consumption.</i> On a seven point scale ranging from very difficult (1) to very easy (7), participants were asked to rate: (a) how easy it would be to completely eliminate conventional meat products from their diet over the next year; and (b) how easy it would be to reduce their consumption of conventional meat products by 25% over the next year.</li>

    <p>In the analyses that follow, we examine consumer attitudes towards clean meat products in five stages. First, before turning to the experimental results, we consider what factors drive consumer sentiment towards clean meat and show that consumers' wariness about clean meat is driven far more by concerns about whether clean meat is natural and healthy &mdash; which are symptoms of the naturalistic heuristic &mdash; than how clean meat products taste or how much they cost. Second, we examine the effects of the three pro-clean meat appeals on consumer willingness-to-pay, interest in, and concerns about clean meat products. Third, we illustrate the pernicious effects of small amounts of anti-acceptance social information. Fourth, we examine whether any of the pro-clean meat appeals were particularly effective or ineffective in the face of anti-acceptance social information. Fifth, we report subgroup heterogeneity in the results, illustrating whether the effects of the pro-clean meat appeals and anti-acceptance social information were concentrated among individuals who reported eating more meat at baseline and who were already wary of clean meat products at baseline.</p>

    <h2>Naturalistic reasoning undermines clean meat acceptance</h2>
    <div id="ssec-naturalistic-reasoning">
      <p>How important are consumer concerns emanating from the naturalistic fallacy &mdash; such as perceptions that clean meat is <q>unnatural</q>, <q>unsafe</q>, or <q>unhealthy</q> &mdash; in undermining willingness to eat clean meat products relative to more conventional consumer concerns, such as price and taste? Here, we show that the former concerns are the main barriers to consumer interest in purchasing and eating clean meat products, while price and taste are only weakly related to consumer interest. <a class="figure" href="#fig-barrier-concerns"></a> illustrates this claim, displaying linear regression coefficients from regressing the change in respondent interest in clean meat between waves 1 and 3 (measured by <i>feel</i>, <i>interest purchase</i>, and <i>would eat</i>) on the change in whether respondent expressed a particular concern about clean meat, while controlling for other concerns raised, baseline demographics, and baseline self-reported meat consumption.</p>

      <p><a class="figure" href="#fig-barrier-concerns"></a> display results across five core concerns: taste, cost, safety, unhealthy, and unnatural. As shown, respondents who went from unconcerned to concerned about clean meat's naturalness between waves 1 and 3 became substantially less interested in clean meat products over the same time period.<span class="footnote">Or, similarly, respondents who went from being concerned to unconcerned about clean meat's naturalness between waves 1 and 3 became substantially more interested in clean meat products over the same time period. The results in <a class="figure" href="#fig-barrier-concerns"></a> average across these two types of respondents &mdash; that is, those who went from concerned to unconcerned and unconcerned to concerned &mdash; as well as respondents who did not change their concern between waves 1 and 3.</span> Specifically, becoming concerned about the naturalness of clean meat is associated with a <span class="data" id="x4"></span> standard deviation decrease in <i>would eat</i> (<span class="data" id="x4_1"></span>) and a <span class="data" id="x5"></span> standard deviation decrease in <i>interest purchase</i>  (<span class="data" id="x5_1"></span>). These patterns are similar for concerns about the health and safety consequences of clean meat products, although the relationship is somewhat weaker regarding safety concerns. In contrast, changes in concerns about taste are not strongly related to interest in clean meat products. Moreover, individuals who reported becoming more concerned about cost between waves 1 and 3 became <i>more</i> interested in clean meat products. This counterintuitive finding may be an artifact of the survey question design, such that respondents with strong negative reactions towards clean meat would have been drawn towards the response options for <q>unnatural</q>, <q>unsafe</q>, and <q>unhealthy</q> (crowding out attention to <q>price</q> and <q>taste</q>), while respondents who either felt indifferent or positive towards clean meat may have gravitated towards price as a de facto concern when no other concerns were particularly salient.</p>

      <!-- <span class="footnote">If anything, increases in concerns about cost and taste are <i>positively</i> associated with interest in clean meat products. This positive association likely flows from the fact that respondent concerns were measured in the form of a multi-choice checkbox question. Respondents with strong anti-clean meat feelings focused on the safety, health effects, and naturalness of clean meat, crowding out attention to cost and taste. Respondents with pro-clean meat feelings tended to only check off taste and/or cost for a lack of alternative concerns, thereby inducing the positive relationship we observe.</span></p> -->

      <p>Among respondents who listed <q>unnatural</q> as a concern in the baseline survey wave, only <span class="data" id="x6_1"></span>% provided an email address at the end of the treatment wave to be notified when clean meat becomes available in their area. In contrast, <span class="data" id="x6_2"></span>% of respondents who did not list <q>unnatural</q> as a concern provided an email address. By comparison, <span class="data" id="x7_1"></span>% of respondents who selected <q>taste</q> as a concern in the baseline survey entered an email address in the treatment wave, compared to <span class="data" id="x7_2"></span>% among respondents not raising <q>taste</q> as a concern in the baseline wave.</p>

      <p>These findings are mirrored in participants' open-ended descriptions of their attitudes towards clean meat products, in which a sizable number of responses were intently focused on the naturalness and health consequences of clean meat. For instance:</p>

      <div class="quotes">
        <blockquote>Respondent A: <q>Gross me out &mdash; no way will I eat this stuff.</q></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Respondent B: <q>I don't like the idea of artificially engineering food products.</q></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Respondent C: <q>I just can't get past the whole <q>unnatural</q>, <q>eating a science experiment</q> brain block.</q></blockquote>
      </div>

      <p>Many other respondents had more moderate reactions, yet still hinted at concerns about the naturalness and health consequences of clean meat products:</p>
      
      <div class="quotes">
        <blockquote>Respondent D: <q>I need to see research on how it affects our bodies long term.</q></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Respondent E: <q>I know academically it's probably healthier, more humane, and won't taste any different [...] However there's a negative gut reaction to it I can't seem to push aside.</q></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Respondent F: <q>It seems strange to eat man made meat.</q></blockquote>
      </div>

      <p>Despite these concerns, there were also a great deal of positive reactions to clean meat products. At the end of the baseline survey (wave 1), <span class="data" id="x1"></span>% of all respondents entered their email address in order to be notified when clean meat products become available in their area. In addition, <span class="data" id="x2"></span>% of respondents answered <q>probably yes</q> or <q>definitely yes</q> to whether they would eat a clean meat product, while <span class="data" id="x3"></span>% of respondents said that they were <q>very interested</q> or <q>extremely interested</q> in purchasing clean meat products.<span class="footnote"><a class="figure" href="#fig-interest"></a> in the <a href="#appendix">Appendix</a> contains further information on these descriptives.</span> In the open-ended responses, these respondents focused overwhelmingly on the anticipated benefits of clean meat products for animal welfare and the environment, while not directly invoking concerns about the naturalness and health consequences of clean meat products. And when these interested consumers did qualify their enthusiasm, it was typically to add the caveat that they hoped clean meat products would taste as good as conventional meat products and would not be dramatically more expensive.</p>

        <span style="font-weight: normal;">Displays estimated standardized effects of a change in concerns about clean meat between waves 1 and 3 on corresponding change in interest in clean meat. Estimates are produced from a simple linear regression of each measure of interest in clean meat on dichotomous indicators representing each concern, as well as controls for baseline demographics and self-reported meat consumption. Dependent variables include: <i>would eat</i> (<q>Would you eat this product?</q>, 1-5 scale), <i>interest purchase</i> (<q>how interested are you in purchasing the clean meat product you just read about?</q>, 1-5 scale), and <i>feel</i> (<q>How do you feel about clean meat products?</q>, 1-7 scale). Dependent variables are standardized to have mean equal to zero and variance equal to one. Horizontal bars represent 90% and 95% confidence intervals.</span>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <p>An important caveat in the results reported in <a class="figure" href="#fig-barrier-concerns"></a> is that we did not experimentally manipulate respondents' perceptions of the unnaturalness of clean meat products (or the salience of this unnaturalness), leaving open the possibility that the observed relationships are driven by some unobserved third factor, or that the causal arrow instead points from interest in clean meat to concerns about its unnaturalness and health consequences. Nevertheless, by examining how <i>changes</i> in respondents' concerns correlate with <i>changes</i> in interest in clean meat over time, our results are robust to alternative explanations based on time-invariant factors. In terms of the direction of causation, our results do not settle the question of the extent to which consumer interest in clean meat is the product of concerns about unnaturalness and health consequences or whether these concerns about clean meat are merely by-products of motivated reasoning among consumers who dislike clean meat for other reasons. Nevertheless, our general finding that consumer interest in clean meat is closely wedded to concerns about naturalness and health consequences, rather than price and taste, should be of particular interest to advocates of clean meat, as well as others studying the formation of consumer opinions towards new food technologies.</p>

      <!-- TRENDS IN CONCERNS BETWEEN WAVES -->
      <p>Finally, given the novelty of clean meat products in the minds of many consumers, could the link between consumer interest and concerns about the naturalness of clean meat products be explained by an initial <q>shock factor</q>, in which we would expect consumer concerns to shift more towards price and taste as consumers become more comfortable with the normalcy of clean meat products? Our results offer some support for this perspective, although future work should examine this question more closely. Looking just at the respondents who were in the control group<span class="footnote">i.e. respondents who read the placebo appeal and who were not exposed to anti-acceptance social information.</span> and who completed all three survey waves (n=<span class="data" id="x8_1"></span>), the percentage of respondents raising <q>unnatural</q> as a concern dropped from <span class="data" id="x8_2"></span>% to <span class="data" id="x8_3"></span>% between the baseline and endline waves (chg = <span class="data" id="x8_4"></span>%; <span class="data" id="x8_5"></span>). Similarly, the percentage of respondents raising <q>unsafe</q> as a concern dropped from <span class="data" id="x9_1"></span>% to <span class="data" id="x9_2"></span>% (chg = <span class="data" id="x9_3"></span>%; <span class="data" id="x9_4"></span>). However, there was virtually no change in the proportion of respondents raising <q>unhealthy</q> as a concern, staying roughly constant at <span class="data" id="x10_1"></span>%.<span class="footnote">In comparison, the proportion of respondents citing <q>cost</q> as a concern increased moderately from <span class="data" id="x11_1"></span>% of respondents to <span class="data" id="x11_2"></span>% (chg = <span class="data" id="x11_3"></span>%; <span class="data" id="x11_4"></span>), while the proportion of respondents raising <q>taste</q> as a concern decreased from <span class="data" id="x12_1"></span>% to <span class="data" id="x12_2"></span>% (chg = <span class="data" id="x12_3"></span>%; <span class="data" id="x12_4"></span>).</span> Hence, while we find some evidence that consumer concerns about clean meat shift <i>away</i> from <q>unnatural</q> and <q>unsafe</q> concerns and move <i>towards</i> concerns about price through repeated exposure (without any further information about the benefits/costs of clean meat), consumer concerns clean meat's health consequences appear more persistent.</p>

      <!-- <p>In short, consumer concerns about the naturalness and health consequences of clean meat products appear to play a major role in consumer interest in these products.</p> -->

    <h2 id="ssec-appeal-effects">Effects of pro-clean meat appeals</h2>
    <div>
      <p>How effective are pro-clean meat appeals &mdash; either based on direct debunking, embracing unnaturalness, or conveying descriptive social norms &mdash; at generating sustained improvements in consumer acceptance of clean meat products? In this subsection, we show that while all three appeals led to encouraging short-term improvements in consumer acceptance of clean meat products, these effects only persisted over the full 10 week post-treatment period for the <i>embrace unnatural</i> appeal.</p>

      <p><a class="figure" href="#fig-effects-dce-wtp"></a> displays the effects of the <i>debunking unnatural</i>, <i>embrace unnatural</i>, and <i>descriptive norm</i> appeals on respondents' marginal willingness-to-pay for clean meat products. We estimate marginal willingness-to-pay from the discrete choice experiment (see <a class="subsection" href="#ssec-outcomes"></a>) using conditional logistic regression, in which the dependent variable is a dichotomous variable <math><msub><mi>y</mi><mi>ijk</mi></msub></math>, representing whether or not respondent <i>i</i> selected alternative <i>k</i> in choice task <i>j</i>. The model specification is:

      <div class="equation">
        <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
          <mi>g</mi>

        </math>
      </div>

      in which <math><mi>g</mi><mfenced>&middot;</mfenced></math> is the inverse logit link, <i>clean</i> is a dichotomous indicator representing whether the alternative is clean meatballs, <i>veg</i> is a dichotomous indicator representing whether the alternative is vegetarian meatballs, <i>cost</i> is the cost of the alternative ($5, $10, $15, or $20), and &alpha;<sub>ij</sub> represents a fixed intercept for each respondent-choice strata. We estimate the &beta;'s using maximum likelihood, and then construct marginal willingness-to-pay estimates for clean meat as the ratio <math><msub><mi>&beta;</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>&sol;</mo><msub><mi>&beta;</mi><mn>3</mn></msub></math> and marginal willingness-to-pay estimates for vegetarian meatballs as the ratio <math><msub><mi>&beta;</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>&sol;</mo><msub><mi>&beta;</mi> <mn>3</mn></msub></math>.<span class="footnote">We estimate standard errors using the Delta method.</span></p>

      <p>Results for respondents' marginal willingness-to-pay for clean meatballs relative to conventional meatballs, as well as vegetarian meatballs versus conventional meatballs, are displayed in <a class="figure" href="#fig-effects-dce-wtp"></a> for both wave 2 (measured immediately after treatment exposure) and wave 3 (10 weeks following treatment exposure). The left panel displays marginal willingness-to-pay among respondents assigned to each of the three treatment appeals and the placebo appeal, while the right panel displays marginal willingness-to-pay among respondents exposed versus not exposed to the anti-acceptance social information treatment. Each point estimate in <a class="figure" href="#fig-effects-dce-wtp"></a> represents respondents' estimated marginal willingness-to-pay for clean (or vegetarian) meatballs relative to conventional meatballs, where negative willingness-to-pay estimates indicate that the clean meatballs would need to be $<i>x</i> cheaper in order for respondents to select clean meatballs over conventional meatballs. Values closer to zero (i.e. to the right in <a class="figure" href="#fig-effects-dce-wtp"></a>) represent a higher marginal willingness-to-pay. See <a class="figure" href="#fig-effects-dce-or"></a> (<a href="#appendix">Appendix</a>) for results reported in odds ratios.</p>

      <p>As anticipated, respondents exhibited a strong preference for conventional meatballs over clean or vegetarian meatballs, resulting in negative marginal willingness-to-pay across all experimental conditions. Respondents also expressed a preference for clean meatballs over vegetarian meatballs on average, as indicated by the rightward shift in the willingness-to-pay estimates for clean meatballs (top row) relative to vegetarian meatballs (bottom row).</p>

      <p>Turning to the effects of the three pro-clean meat appeals, the <i>embrace unnatural</i> significantly increased respondents' willingness-to-pay for clean meat products relative to placebo, which persisted over the entire 10 week followup period. This difference is substantively large: whereas participants who read the placebo article would, on average, need cultured meatballs to be $<span class="data" id="x13_0"></span> cheaper than conventional meatballs in order to prefer the former (95% CI: <span class="data" id="x13_0_0"></span>, <span class="data" id="x13_0_1"></span>), respondents who read the <i>embrace unnatural</i> appeal needed only $<span class="data" id="x13_2"></span> on average (95% CI: <span class="data" id="x13_2_0"></span>, <span class="data" id="x13_2_1"></span>). Moreover, given that the <i>embrace unnatural</i> appeal led to no detectable increase in willingness-to-pay for vegetarian meatballs (relative to readers of the placebo appeal), this finding is unlikely to be a product of social desirability.</p>

      <!-- (<i>WTP</i> = $<span class="data" id="x13_0_v"></span>; 95% CI: <span class="data" id="#x13_0_0_v"></span>, <span class="data" id="#x13_0_1_v"></span>) -->

      <p>In contrast, while the <i>social norms</i> appeal led to the largest <i>initial</i> gains in willingness-to-pay (as measured in wave 2), these effects largely disappeared by the followup survey 10 weeks later. Nevertheless, the <i>social norms</i> appeal continued to produce moderate improvements in willingness-to-pay over this time span. Finally, the <i>debunk unnatural</i> appeal had no significant effects on willingness-to-pay for clean meatballs, whether measured immediately after treatment exposure or 10 weeks later.</p>

We estimate the average treatment effects (ATE) of each pro-clean meat appeal by comparing the <i>change</i> in each outcome variable <i>y</i> since wave 1 across respondents who read the treatment appeal versus respondents who read the placebo appeal.

      <p>As shown in Panels 1-3 of <a class="figure" href="#fig-effects"></a>, all three pro-clean meat appeals led to initial improvements in consumer interest in clean meat between waves 1 and 2 (relative to the placebo article). As intended, the <i>debunk unnatural</i> and <i>embrace unnatural</i> appeals also led to decreases in concerns about whether clean meat products are unnatural.<span class="footnote">The <i>social norms</i> appeal also led to a non-trivial reduction in the number of respondents raising the <q>unnatural</q> concern, yet this effect does not reach conventional levels of statistical significance. The <i>embrace unnatural</i> and <i>social norms</i> appeals may have also led to sizable reductions in concerns about the safety of clean meat, which should be expected given that the former emphasizes that clean meat is not very different from many other safe food products and the latter normalizes clean meat products by emphasizing widespread consumer excitement about their availability. However, these effects do not reach conventional levels of statistical significance.</span> For instance, the proportion of respondents in the <i>debunk unnatural</i> arm raising <q>unnatural</q> as a concern decreased by roughly <span class="data" id="x14_0"></span> percentage points more between waves 1 and 2 than among respondents who read the placebo article (SE=<span class="data" id="x14_1"></span>; <span class="data" id="x14_2"></span>).</p>

      <!-- In both figures, outcome variables are measured in terms of the change between baseline and endline surveys. We discuss the main results below. -->

      <p>However, these encouraging initial findings for the <i>debunking unnatural</i> and <i>descriptive norms</i> appeals were short-lived. By the 10 week followup study, consumer interest in clean meat across all three measures was no higher among respondents reading either of these appeals relative to respondents who read the placebo appeal. In addition, respondents who read these two appeals were no longer any less likely to raise concerns about the naturalness, safety, or health consequences of clean meat products compared to respondents who read the placebo appeal.</p>

      <!-- Overall, however, these encouraging effects on attitudes and concerns did not persist over time. While the <i>social norms</i> appeal consistently had marginally larger effects on attitudes and concerns in wave 2 compared to the other two appeals, these effects had completely shrunk to zero by wave 3 (10 weeks after treatment exposure). The same pattern emerges for the <i>debunking unnatural</i> appeal, where the positive effects on interest in clean meat at wave 2 disappear when considering wave 3 measures of interest in clean meat.  -->

      <!-- SUMMARY -->
      <p>In short, the <i>embrace unnatural</i> appeal is the only appeal for which we find reasonably strong evidence of a persistent improvement in consumer acceptance of clean meat products up to 10 weeks following treatment exposure. While the <i>descriptive norms</i> appeal had encouraging enduring effects on marginal willingness-to-pay, these positive effects were not mirrored in our attitudinal measures of interest in clean meat. Finally, the <i>debunk unnatural</i> appeal failed to have any enduring effects on consumer acceptance of clean meat.</p>

      <!-- This lack of persistence is especially concerning given that the pernicious effects of anti-acceptance social information continued to suppress interest in clean meat after 10 weeks. -->

    <h2>Effects of negative social information</h2>
    <div id="ssec-social-information-effects">
      <!-- MOTIVATION -->
      <p>As we described in <a class="subsection" href="#ssec-naturalistic-reasoning"></a>, a sizable minority of consumers have a positive orientation towards clean meat products, yet at the same time many consumers are wary about the naturalness and health consequences of these products. How contagious are the anti-clean meat attitudes of these wary consumers? In this section, we examine the extent to which snippets of anti-clean meat social information undermine consumer interest in clean meat products. As described in <a class="subsection" href="#ssec-experimental-conditions"></a>, respondents were randomly assigned to be exposed or not exposed to anti-acceptance social information at the beginning of the treatment wave, consisting of five short quotes from respondents to a previous survey expressing negative sentiment towards clean meat (e.g. <q>Our guts are not meant to digest unnatural things</q>).</p>

      <!-- &mdash; in the form of negative sentiment towards clean meat expressed by respondents from a previous survey &mdash;  -->

      <!-- DESCRIPTION OF EFFECTS ON DISCRETE CHOICE -->
      <p>We examine the effects of anti-clean meat social information on willingness-to-pay, interest, concerns, and perceived benefits using the same methods described in <a class="subsection" href="#ssec-appeal-effects"></a> above. The results are displayed alongside the appeal effects in <a class="figure" href="#fig-effects-dce-wtp"></a> (right column) and <a class="figure" href="#fig-effects"></a> (bottom panel). </p>

      <p>Overall, there is strong evidence that negative social information undermined respondents' marginal willingness-to-pay for clean meat and interest in clean meat, with these effects persisting over the 10 week post-treatment study period. In wave 2, negative social information decreased respondents' marginal willingness-to-pay for clean meatballs versus conventional meatballs from &ndash;$<span class="data" id="x13_0_s2"></span> (95% CI: <span class="data" id="x13_0_0_s2"></span>, <span class="data" id="x13_0_1_s2"></span>) to &ndash;$<span class="data" id="x13_1_s2"></span> (95% CI: <span class="data" id="x13_1_0_s2"></span>, <span class="data" id="x13_1_1_s2"></span>). These effects had decayed somewhat by the 10 week followup survey yet remained large: respondents exposed to negative social information in wave 3 would have needed clean meatballs to be $<span class="data" id="x13_1_s3"></span> less expensive than conventional meatballs in order to prefer the former (95% CI: <span class="data" id="x13_1_0_s3"></span>, <span class="data" id="x13_1_1_s3"></span>), while unexposed respondents only needed clean meatballs to be $<span class="data" id="x13_0_s3"></span> less expensive on average (95% CI: <span class="data" id="x13_0_0_s3"></span>, <span class="data" id="x13_0_1_s3"></span>). Negative social information also led to significant reduction in respondents' interest in clean meat after 10 weeks, whether measured in terms of <i>feel</i>, <i>interest purchase</i>, or <i>would eat</i>.</p>

      <!-- For instance, exposed respondents reported a significant decrease in willingness to try clean meat products (<i>would eat</i>: d=-0.31; p < 0.01) and interest in purchasing meat products (<i>interest purchase</i>: d=-0.32; p < 0.01) between waves 1 and 2 relative to unexposed respondents. In addition, anti-acceptance social information led to increases in concerns about the health effects (<i>concern unhealthy</i>: d=0.07; p < 0.01) and safety (<i>concern unsafe</i>: d=0.06; p < 0.01) of clean meat products between waves 1 and 2. -->

      <!-- <p>Despite some attenuation, these effects persist when examining the corresponding changes between waves 1 and 3 (10 weeks after treatment). For instance, even after 10 weeks, exposed respondents reported a significant decrease in willingness to try clean meat products (<i>would eat</i>: d=-0.17; p < 0.01) and interest in purchasing meat products (<i>interest purchase</i>: d=-0.13; p < 0.05) between waves 1 and 2 relative to unexposed respondents. Exposed respondents also remained more likely to report concerns about the health effects of clean meat products (<i>concern unhealthy</i>: d=0.04; p < 0.09). Exposed respondents were also somewhat more likely than unexposed respondents to report concerns about whether clean meat is natural (<i>concern unnatural</i>; d=0.04; p = 0.2), although this difference does not reach conventional levels of statistical significance.</p> -->

      <!-- Why? One important difference is that the negative information was delivered in the form of a social signal. While the <i>social norms</i> treatment arm did not have comparably large positive effects, this could be due to the fact that the <i>social norms</i> treatment communicated the social norm indirectly, whereas the anti-acceptance social information gave participants more of a sense that they were directly viewing how others felt about the products. -->

      <p>These results are disconcerting, showing that extremely weak forms of anti-acceptance social information &mdash; as in the form of five short quotes from completely anonymous individuals &mdash; can undermine consumer acceptance of new food technologies for at least 10 weeks post-treatment. Even worse, these negative effects persist despite the fact that most respondents in our study were asked to read a pro-clean meat appeal immediately after exposure to the anti-acceptance social information.<span class="footnote">Except for those exposed to the placebo appeal.</span></p>

    <h2 id="ssec-combating-social-information">Combating negative social information</h2>
    <div>
      <p>As we showed in <a class="figure" href="#fig-effects"></a>, the <i>debunk unnatural</i> and <i>descriptive norms</i> appeals counteracted much of the pernicious effects of anti-acceptance social information in the <i>short-term</i>, but not over longer periods. In contrast, we found reasonably strong evidence that the <i>embrace unnatural</i> leads to long-lasting improvements in consumer acceptance of clean meat, roughly on the same order of magnitude as the negative effects of anti-acceptance social information. However, these patterns do not shed light on whether the effectiveness of any of these appeals <i>interacts</i> with the presence the anti-acceptance social information &mdash; that is, whether any of the appeals become significantly more or less effective when preceded by anti-acceptance social information. For instance, while the <i>debunk unnatural</i> appeal had no positive effects on consumer acceptance in the aggregate, it may have been effective as an immediate counterpoint to negative social information. Conversely, while the <i>embrace unnatural</i> appeal had encouraging effects in the aggregate, negative social information could possibly shortcut these gains by priming individuals with the negative association between food naturalness and health/safety consequences.</p>

      <p>We examine the possibility of these interactions in <a class="figure" href="#fig-subgroup-effects-negative"></a>, displaying the effects of each appeal on respondents' change in interest in clean meat products between waves 1 and 3, broken down by whether respondents were exposed to anti-acceptance social information in wave 2 or not. While the <i>embrace unnatural</i> and <i>descriptive norms</i> appeals are no more/less effective at improving consumer acceptance in the face of anti-acceptance social information, we find suggestive evidence that the <i>debunking unnatural</i> had a backfire effect on consumer interest and concerns when preceded by anti-acceptance social information. For instance, among respondents <i>not</i> exposed to anti-acceptance social information, the <i>debunking unnatural appeal</i> had virtually no effect on the proportion of respondents concerned about the naturalness of clean meat (ATE=<span class="data" id="x15_0"></span>; <span class="data" id="x15_1"></span>). Among respondents exposed to the anti-acceptance social information, the <i>debunking unnatural</i> appeal led to an <i>increase</i> in the proportion of respondents between waves 1 and 3 (relative to placebo) who were concerned about clean meat's unnaturalness (ATE=<span class="data" id="x16_0"></span>; p = <span class="data" id="x16_1"></span>). The evidence for this backfire effect should not be overstated, given imprecision in the estimated coefficients. Nevertheless, the consistency in this backfire effect across all three measures of clean meat, as well as concerns about unnaturalness and concerns about health consequences is noteworthy.</p>

        <p>Were the effects of the <i>embrace unnatural</i> concentrated among individuals who were already sympathetic towards clean meat products?

        </figure>

        <p>This Figure contains three main insights. First, anti-acceptance social information has little persistent effect on individuals who were already very interested in clean meat at baseline (bottom row of <a class="figure" class="figure" href="#fig-subgroup-effects-interest"></a>). Instead, anti-acceptance social information undermines interest in clean meat among respondents with low to moderate levels of existing interest in clean meat products. On the one hand, this result is encouraging, suggesting that once consumers have been won over, then they are more resilient to negative coverage of new food technologies. On the other hand, high levels of susceptibility to anti-acceptance social information among consumers with low to moderate interest in clean meat amplifies the challenge of converting skeptics into regular consumers of clean meat products.</p>

        <p>Second, the positive effects of <i>embrace unnatural</i> are concentrated among the respondents who were <i>least</i> interest in clean meat products at baseline. This result is encouraging, and is consistent with the results in <a class="subsection" href="#ssec-combating-social-information"></a> suggesting that the <i>embrace unnatural</i> appeal is best suited for combating the pernicious effects of anti-acceptance social information, given that anti-acceptance social information had the largest effects on the least interested consumers.</p>
        <p>Third, consistent with the main results reported in <a class="figure" href="#fig-effects"></a>, we find no evidence that the <i>debunking unnatural</i> and <i>descriptive norms</i> increased consumer acceptance of clean meat products, regardless of whether consumers were more or less interested in clean meat at baseline.</p>

      <h3 id="ssec-influence-meateaters">Effects on largest meat consumers</h3>
      <div>
        <p>For clean meat products to achieve significant environmental, animal welfare, and health impacts, they will need to be adopted by typical meat-eaters rather than vegetarians and those who only eat a few servings of meat products each week. In <a class="figure" href="#fig-subgroup-effects-meat"></a> (see <a href="#appendix">Appendix</a>), we estimate the effects of the pro-clean meat appeals and anti-acceptance social information separately for individuals who reported eating 0-10 servings of meat per week at baseline, 10.5-17 servings of meat per week at baseline, and more than 17 servings of meat per week at baseline.<span class="footnote">These cutpoints correspond to the 33rd and 66th percentiles in self-reported baseline meat consumption.</span> While the coefficients in these plots are estimated too imprecisely to warrant any strong conclusions, two suggestive patterns are worth noting. First, anti-acceptance social information undermines interest in clean meat across low, moderate, and high frequency meat-eaters. Second, there is weak evidence suggesting that the <i>debunking unnatural</i> and <i>descriptive norms</i> appeals led to a backfire effect among moderate and high frequency meat-eaters, while the positive effects of the <i>embrace unnatural</i> appeal appear to be more concentrated among low frequency meat-eaters. These suggestive patterns should be scrutinized more closely in future work.</p>

  <!--            SECTION: CONCLUDING REMARKS             -->
  <!-- ================================================== -->
  <h1>Concluding remarks</h1>
  <section id="sec-concluding-remarks">
    <p>While clean meat products may be available in stores in the next five years, very little research has examined how consumer attitudes towards clean meat products are shaped by short snippets of information exchanged in social networks and what kinds of pro-clean meat messaging campaigns can be effective at generating sustained increases in consumer acceptance. In this study, we have introduced three main sets of findings, which are of broad relevance to scholars studying how individuals form opinions and make choices regarding new products and technologies. First, we showed that consumers' wariness about clean meat is driven far more by concerns about whether clean meat is natural and healthy than how clean meat products taste or how much they cost. Second, we showed that the <i>embracing unnatural</i> appeal led to sustained increases in consumers' willingness-to-pay and interest in clean meat over a 10 week period, while the positive effects of the <i>debunking unnatural</i> and <i>descriptive norms</i> appeals were short-lived. Third, in stark contrast to the ineffectiveness of these two latter appeals, we showed that small snippets of negative social information about clean meat from complete strangers undermines consumer acceptance of clean meat products substantially, and that these effects persist for at least 10 weeks.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, these findings are disconcerting. The ineffectiveness of <q>misperception correction</q> and <q>direct debunking</q> appeals at shifting public attitudes has been well-documented in a variety of domains where attitudes are crystallized and/or deeply polarized, yet our findings go a step further by showing that this approach is ineffective even in domains where many individuals have not had sufficient exposure to form strong opinions. Making matters worse, we show that potential consumers are susceptible to extremely small amounts of negative information from complete strangers. Hence, while successfully debunking the naturalistic heuristic remains a significant challenge, fueling it apparently does not. This finding is particularly disconcerting in light of the dramatic increase in consumers' access to negative social information through social media and other online sources. For new technologies such as clean meat that appear risky in the minds of many consumers, this access to anti-acceptance social information can easily undermine concerted informational campaigns by pro-acceptance advocates.</p>
    
    <!-- Given that online information and social media are an important source of misinformation that drives negative attitudes towards many technologies and products (e.g. GM foods, vaccines, nuclear power), this asymmetry in the effects of information raises serious concerns about the acceptance of clean meat products and other new technologies that conflict with consumers' cultural intuitions about what is <q>good</q>. -->

    <!-- This finding may help to explain the rise of public skepticism towards vaccines, GM foods, and other technologies despite concerted informational campaigns and other efforts by advocates to increase public acceptance. Specifically, the rise of social media has dramatically increased consumers' access to snippets of opinions and information from others in their social networks. 
 -->

    <p>On the other hand, our results provide optimism that an <i>embrace unnatural</i> messaging strategy can be effective at generating sustained improvements in public acceptance for clean meat products. By leveraging the fact that individuals already consume a wide range of products that they would struggle to rationalize as <q>natural</q>, this messaging strategy nudges potential consumers towards adding clean meat products to their mental category of safe and healthy products as the easiest way to resolve internal dissonance. It is unclear whether the efficacy of this messaging strategy is limited to new technologies for which consumers have had little previous exposure. Nevertheless, these findings should be of broad interest to advocates of childhood vaccinations, GM foods, and other technologies that face substantial public resistance via the naturalistic heuristic.</p>
