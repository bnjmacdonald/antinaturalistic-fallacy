    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <!-- While existing evidence suggests that messaging appeals based on debunking this heuristic are ineffective at increasing consumer acceptance, there is little evidence on whether this ineffectiveness extends to new products for which consumers have not yet formed crystallized opinions.  -->
    <p>The naturalistic heuristic of <q>what is natural is good</q> poses a serious barrier to consumer adoption of genetically modified foods, childhood vaccinations, and related technologies. In this study, we examine three messaging strategies &mdash; direct debunking, embracing unnaturalness, and descriptive norms &mdash; for overcoming consumer resistance in the context of a new food technology: <q>clean meat</q> (also known as <q>cultured</q> or <q>in vitro</q> meat). We compare the effects of these three pro-clean meat appeals against the undermining effects of being exposed to anti-clean meat reactions from other potential consumers. We find persistent negative effects of the anti-clean meat social information over 10 weeks. Of the three pro-clean meat appeals, only the embrace unnaturalness appeal successfully offset the undermining effects of anti-clean meat social information over the 10 week study period, suggesting that advocates wishing to enhance consumer acceptance of new food technologies should focus on how these technologies are similar to products that also seem <q>unnatural</q> but which are already widely adopted by consumers.</p>
